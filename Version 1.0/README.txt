Title: LIDAR Visualizations
Version: 1.0

Purpose:
Using LIDAR data from the City Of Montreal's OpenData Portal, an attempt will be made to create unique, and aesthetically pleasing visualizations. However, before an attempt at visualizing the data can be made the data must be first downloaded. In this version a mass downloader was created to pull .LAZ files from the data depot. Additionally, an extraction program was created to turn the .LAZ files into .LAS files.
 

Note:
Once completed one would realize that there are roughly 682 .LAZ files within the City Of Montreal's data portal. In total, the compressed files take up 3.5GB of space; note that these are the compressed files.
